==========================

Using script from: https://github.com/FrankM1/radium-one-click-demo-install

This library works by importing wordpress content, widgets  and theme options with just one click.

**Requirements:**

* Content.xml - generated using the Worpress Content Exporter plugin
* Widget.json - generated using the Widget Importer Exporter plugin. Rename it from .wie to .json
* theme_options.txt - generated using the theme options frameworks such as Redux Framework, NHP Options Framework or Radium Framework

##How to use:
Keep the unzipped folder in /wp-content/mu-plugins/ folder. If there is no mu-plugins, just create one and paste in there.
